# Twitter's Implementation of Hashtag Detection

I've stripped down the barebones logic of the [twitter-text API](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text/tree/master/js) to better understand how they detect hashtags.

## Demo

Quick demo here: http://adrianmcli.com/twitter-hashtag/

## Installation

If you'd like to run this locally, clone the repo, do `npm install`, and then launch the server with `npm start`.

```
git clone https://github.com/adrianmc/twitter-hashtag.git
cd twitter-hashtag
npm install
npm start
```
